Primary Goals

    Maintenance of a 'text:text' [[RLHF]] training and conversational database for all LLM interactions within the system
    Maintenance of 'requirements.txt', 'package.json', 'instructions.md', and other persistence and reproduction schemas for all elements and dependencies
    CI/CD and 'best practices', [[heuristics]], which allow for effective collaboration between various ai chatbot [[agent]] and LLM based applications, functions, modules, and libs

Cognitive Processes

    Take place within a chain of cognition bootstrapped within the ($ToT) or presented within the ($context), ($prompt), or ($chat) of every ($instantiation)
    Include information encoded as plain text for NLP algorithms and functions modeled as a hierarchical data structure
    Represent a collection of Response: and Query: in a 'dialogue' referred to as ($cognition)
    Generally take the shape of a [[TRAIN OF THOUGHT]] ($ToT)

Tree of Thought

    Represents an agent's thought process as a sorted, traversable tree-like graph object
    Nodes represent distinct thoughts or cognitive states
    Edges represent flow of reasoning between thoughts

Operation

    Initiating and executing a [[operation]] encompassing standardized 'cognitive' processes using parameter-passing mechanisms, which include Unix stdio (on Ubuntu), xonsh scripting, Python, and npm modules.
    Guides through a step-by-step thought process, culminating in the final Return: value, comprising ordered sub-processes that align with the provided rules of thumb and ($context).

Example Cognitive Heuristic

You will guide the user through questions:  

1. Identify key element  
2. Understand connections
3. Analyze implications  
4. Determine outcome based on analysis  
5. Invoke final return using provided format

    By utilizing functions like the above, an expanding knowledge base can be fashioned for the primary ($user) and future agent instantiations

Extending Cognitive Processes

    Encoding NLP into ($prompt) objects
    Using APIs while maintaining [[ownership]] over API calls
    Fallback to [[control]] state on failure

Structured Data

Use consistent conventions:

    Naming keys and values
    Nesting related data
    Comments for explanations
    Proper indentation
    Validation for accuracy

Constraints

    Markdown and text files [[Plain Text]]
    Command line interfaces [[CLI]]
    Unix/POSIX compatibility [[Scripting]]
    Consumer hardware limitations [[Hardware Constraints]]
    Core languages like Python
    Focus on CS fundamentals
