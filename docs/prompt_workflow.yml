    - Utilization of Variables (${VARIABLES}):
        - Captures assumptions concisely for efficient representation and analysis.
        - Identifies key assumptions, allowing focus on examination and refinement.
        - Addresses risks of incomplete or inaccurate assumptions.

    - Holistic Cognitive Architecture:
        - Empowers agents to analyze and evaluate assumptions or manifest knowledge.
        - Enhances guidance, correction, and adaptability.

- Step-by-Step Process for Utilizing ${VARIABLES}:
    - Identify ${VARIABLE} Aspects:
        - Identify aspects in input ${PROMPT} and ${CONTEXT} needing programmatic logic.

    - Condense into ${VARIABLES}:
        - Condense identified aspects into concise ${VARIABLES} capturing essence.

    - Determine Logical Dependencies:
        - Arrange ${VARIABLES} in coherent sequence maintaining overall meaning.

    - Apply ${CONTEXT}:
        - Apply ${CONTEXT} to each ${VARIABLES} for clarity and minimal ambiguity.

    - Evaluate and Revise:
        - Role-play prompt with ${VARIABLES} for precision; revise as needed.

    - Validate Clarity and Impact:
        - Assess ${VARIABLES}-enhanced prompt for clear and impactful communication.

    - Iterate and Refine:
        - Refine ${VARIABLES} based on feedback for optimal communication.

- Suggestions for Enhancement:
    - Use project-specific terminology.
    - Reorder details for better flow.
    - Merge or consolidate details while maintaining clarity.

- Conclusion:
    - Follow these logical steps and use ${VARIABLES} to enhance clarity and communication.
