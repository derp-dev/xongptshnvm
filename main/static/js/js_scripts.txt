It waits for the window to load (window.onload = function() { ... }) before executing the code inside the function.
    It retrieves references to the relevant DOM elements (replInput, replOutput, markdownEditor) based on their respective id attributes.
    It adds an event listener to the replInput element for the keydown event. When the "Enter" key is pressed, it prevents the default behavior (submitting a form or creating a new line) and performs the following actions:
        Retrieves the code entered in the replInput textarea.
        Clears the replInput textarea.
        Sends a POST request to the '/generate' endpoint with the code as JSON data.
        Processes the response: If the status is 'success', it appends the message to the replOutput textarea; otherwise, it appends an error message.
        Handles any errors that may occur during the request or response.
    It adds an event listener to the markdownEditor element for the keydown event. When the "Tab" key is pressed, it prevents the default behavior (adding a tab character) and instead inserts a tab character at the current cursor position in the markdownEditor textarea.
